## PC Parts Database Project

### Project Description

Our project is about modeling PC components to allow users to understand how different parts of a PC work together and what is required to create your own PC. Using this database, users will be able to look up the price of different PC parts and customize their own PC. They can add parts to the tables to keep track of the parts that they want and get some summary query results from the parts they have added such as filtering for keyboards by their brand, colour, percentage and price, finding keyboards and mouses that have the same colour or brand, and finding the average, maximum, or minimum price of GPU(s) based on brand or number of fans.

### Changes in Schema

We had to remove the table Mouse_Brand because the Oracle account we were provided with only allowed us to have a maximum of 30 tables. If we included Mouse_Brand, we would have 31 tables which would exceed the space quota we are given to work with in Oracle. We chose to remove this table as it seemed to be a little trivial and we assumed it would not affect the final project much.
